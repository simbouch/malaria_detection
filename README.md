# Malaria Detection Application

This application is designed to facilitate the detection of malaria from blood smear images using a deep learning-based image classification model. It provides an intuitive interface to upload images and receive predictions, making it accessible for medical practitioners and researchers.

## Features

### Automated Malaria Detection
- Utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying blood smear images.
- Outputs the prediction as "Saine" (Uninfected) or "Parasit√©e" (Parasitized) with high accuracy.

### User-Friendly Web Interface
- Built with Flask, providing a seamless image upload feature.
- Displays classification results directly on the interface.

### Preprocessing
- Automatically resizes uploaded images to the model's input size (130x130 pixels).
- Normalizes pixel values for improved prediction accuracy.

## How to Use

### Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/simbouch/malaria_detection
    cd malaria_detection
    ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.**

### Using the Application
1. Navigate to the upload page.
2. Upload an image file of a blood smear (JPEG, PNG formats supported).
3. Submit the image and wait for the classification result to be displayed.
